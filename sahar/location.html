                Description: This easy walking trail gives you an excellent introduction to the Azraq Wetland Reserve. The boardwalk leads you through dry and wet areas to a viewing platform overlooking the artesian pools that once released millions of cubic meters of water into the marshland. After leaving the platform, the trail takes you over an ancient black basalt wall, most likely constructed by an Umayyad Caliph. The trail then leads to a bird hide made of local mud brick where you can observe the migratory birds and perhaps catch a glimpse of the water buffalo. Follow the trail back to the Visitor Center, passing yet another part of the ancient basalt wall.

             Grade: Difficult

             Distance: 16 km

             Time: 7-8 hours

            Starting time: 6:30 a.m.

            Group size: 10-20 people

            Description: Continue along the gravel river bed of the Wadi, alongside a flowing stream, to the entrance to Wadi Ghweir. Very similar to the famous Siq in Petra, the trail leads through magnificent sceneries of different stone formations and many unique plants and trees on both sides of the river. The scenery is so breathtaking it has been known to cause visitors to forget about everything else -- including how long they have been hiking! After 3.5 hours, you will have tea and you can rest and learn more about the area from your guide. From there, continue to the Byzantine archaeology at Khirbet Feynan until you reach your final destination at Feynan Ecolodge.
